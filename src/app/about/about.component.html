      I started my coding journey in 2009, but only started writing code
      professionally in 2014. I currently work at

      Engineer, where I build efficient systems and integrations to make
      payments easier for over 2 million users.

    <p>
      My mostly used languages Node.js (Typescript and Javascript), and Golang,
      although I only recently started using Golang. When I need a GraphQL API,
      I use Apollo GraphQL. I also implement micro services with gRPC.

      of
